# Portable-TLauncher
> A more portable version of TLauncher. Portable in the sense that we already have the required files needed for the program to run.

# Licensing Notices

# Setup Tutorial
TLauncher requires an AppData folder directory and other things to actually work. What you need to do is correct the respective ".minecraft" and ".tlauncher" folders and place the respective files into those folders. Simple as that.
